# Container Shapes

Container shapes determine how a potion is **held**, **poured**, **consumed**, or **stored**. While they don't typically affect potion potency, they impact **portability**, **usage**, and **bulk handling**. Each container is created by combining one **material** and one **shape**, optionally enhanced with **add-ons**.

##  Shape Properties

Each shape entry includes:

- **Capacity**: How many portions/doses the shape can hold.
    
- **Portability**: How easily it can be carried or stored on a person.
    
- **Accessibility**: How easily contents can be consumed or dispensed.
    
- **Refill Type**: Whether it can be refilled directly or requires a funnel/adapter.
    
- **Special Use Cases**: Anything unique about its handling or purpose.
    
- **Size Class**: Small / Medium / Large / Bulk

## Size Class

- **Medium**: Flask, Sprayer – belt pouches or holsters.

## Crafting Notes

- Shapes must be chosen during container crafting.
    
- Certain shapes require specialized molds, tools, or stations to craft (e.g., glassblowing for vials, cooper’s tools for jugs).
    
- Shape alone does not affect potion properties but may be required for **add-ons** or special station interactions.
