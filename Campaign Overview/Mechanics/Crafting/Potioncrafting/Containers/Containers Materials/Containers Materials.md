# Container Materials

Container materials define the physical and magical properties of a bottle, vial, flask, or storage unit. Each container is constructed from one **material** and one **shape** (defined in the corresponding folder), and may include **add-ons**. Material governs durability, potion compatibility, aging behavior, and more.

##  Material Properties

Each material comes with specific traits:

- **Durability**: Resistance to environmental or physical damage.
    
- **Reactivity**: Whether it interacts with magical or alchemical contents.
    
- **Clarity**: How visible the contents are (important for inspection, secrecy, or detection).
    
- **Weight**: Impacts portability and bulk (especially in bulk containers).
    
- **Aging Modifier**: Alters the natural aging speed of the stored potion (slows, accelerates, or stabilizes).
    
- **Compatibility Tags**: Describes which potions, reagents, or catalysts it synergizes with or resists.
    
- **Special Properties** _(optional)_: Loreful or magical effects that give the container unique behavior.
