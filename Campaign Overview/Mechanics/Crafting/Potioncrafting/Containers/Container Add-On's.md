# Container Add-Ons

**Container Add-Ons** are modular enhancements that can be installed into compatible containers to improve functionality, durability, control, or security. They offer a way to tailor containers for specialized brews, dangerous potions, or advanced logistics systems.

Each add-on has its own requirements, effects, and limitations.

---

##  Installation Rules

- Only **Add-On Compatible** containers (tagged) can accept add-ons.
    
- Add-ons may be **removable** or **permanently bonded** depending on their type and crafting method.
    
- Most containers support **1–2 add-ons**, though high-tier or rare ones may allow more.
    
- Installing incompatible add-ons (e.g., conflicting effects) will fail or cause degradation.
    
- Some add-ons may require specific **materials**, **crafting stations**, or **shapes** to be installed.

## Add-On Crafting

- Add-ons are crafted separately from containers and installed afterward.
    
- Most require materials tied to **container shape**, **material**, or **station tier**.
    
- Some add-ons are consumed on use (like Tamper Seals), others are permanent.

## Add-On Tags

Add-ons may have their own internal tags for categorization (e.g., `Reusable`, `Single-Use`, `High-Risk`, `Alchemy-Only`). These are listed in their own documentation if needed later.
