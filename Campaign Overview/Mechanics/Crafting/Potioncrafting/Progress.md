- **Brewing Stations** — Complete ruleset including stats, environmental effects, and station themes.
    
- **Containers** — Fully detailed system with:
    
    - Container Bases
        
    - Size Rules
        
    - Durability and Aging
        
    - Crafting & Acquisition Guidelines
        
    - Tags (centralized)
        
    - Add-ons (centralized)

### 🧪 Optional & Expansion Content

- **Expanded Alchemy Index** → You asked for elaboration: This would be a high-level hub page or file that maps out the whole alchemy system:
    
    - Summary of major mechanics (stations, MTAs, containers, reagents, catalysts, storage, mishaps, aging, etc.)
        
    - Navigational tool in Obsidian (perhaps enhanced with visual flowcharts or links)
        
    - Could also list system design philosophies, glossary, and rules references.
        
- **Special Artifacts / Unique Crafting Schematics** → End-stage content, maybe high-end rewards, relics, or custom potion containers with lore and exotic traits.
