#  Magical Tool Aids (MTAs)

##  What Are MTAs?

Magical Tool Aids (MTAs) are modular magical components, upgrades, or augmentations that enhance the various systems involved in potion brewing, storage, bottling, and field deployment. They come with unique effects, limitations, and trade-offs that encourage thoughtful customization rather than raw power scaling. MTAs provide tangible choices that shape how a brewing operation functions at every stage.

##  MTA Application Categories

Each MTA is designed to be compatible with a specific system or use-case. The main categories are:

### • Brewing Stations
MTAs that install directly into Brewing Stations. They affect base mechanics like brewing time, mishap risk, ingredient volatility, or special property amplification. Each station has a limited number of MTAs it can support.

### • Ingredient & Potion Storage Units
Designed for storage chambers, vaults, shelves, or magical fridges. These MTAs manage spoilage resistance, temperature control, magical stability, potion aging processes, or enhanced preservation conditions.

### • Carriable Container Units
Formerly referred to as flask/bottle MTAs, this category includes MTAs installed into or passively linked with containers used for carrying potions—such as vials, flasks, injection tubes, or crystalline vessels. They can grant shock resistance, leak protection, instant-access mechanics, or safe handling traits. Some MTAs here don’t require installation and function passively.

### • Bottling Units
These MTAs affect the process of bottling potions, either:
- Directly from the Brewing Station, or  
- From Storage Units during post-processing.  
They may improve sealing, transfer efficiency, potion consistency, or even infuse magic into the potion during the final phase.

### • Freeform MTAs
These are unattached magical tools that aren’t tied to a system directly. Some function as passive enchantments in a brewing room, or as aura emitters, ritual devices, or reactive elements. They do not require installation but often require physical placement, attunement, or setup.

##  Installation Rules

- **Installed vs Passive:** Most MTAs must be installed into an application by someone with expertise. Some, especially those related to portable flasks or Freeform MTAs, operate without installation.
- **Application Limits:** Brewing Stations, Storages, and Bottling Units have a maximum number of MTAs they can support.
- **Expertise Required:** Installing MTAs typically requires magical or alchemical know-how, handled by high-tier brewers or specific NPCs. Players may unlock this through quests or alliances.

##  Functionality and Limitations

- **Not All Beneficial:** Some MTAs provide trade-offs—offering powerful advantages while introducing drawbacks (e.g., instability, increased mishap range, or power drain).
- **Tier Compatibility:** Each MTA defines which **Tiers of application** it can be installed into. You cannot force high-level MTAs into low-tier stations unless specified.
- **Inter-System Interaction:** MTAs may affect core systems—such as brewing volatility, aging processes, magical interactions, or mishap outcomes.
- **Unique Effects:** Many MTAs have distinct effects, altering fundamental mechanics instead of flat stats.
- **Trade-Off Design:** Every MTA must be evaluated based on context; powerful ones may have significant weaknesses.
- **Selective Availability:** While some MTAs can be crafted, most are found, rewarded, or bought. Their integration often serves as a narrative milestone.

##  Tier & Rarity System

Each MTA carries both a **Tier** and a **Rarity**, which reflect two different aspects of their power and availability:

- **Tier:** Indicates the MTA’s complexity and strength. Higher-tier MTAs are often meant for advanced setups or provide broader systemic influence.
- **Rarity:** Represents how common or unique the MTA is within the world. This affects narrative placement and uniqueness.

> Example: **Tier 6 - Rare**  
> → A rare MTA designed for use in Tier 6 applications. It may have powerful but narrow effects or high versatility but low accessibility.

This dual system works like RPG item design: A lower-tier Legendary may outperform a common high-tier item in some respects, but lose out in raw power scaling.

---

##  Design Philosophy

- MTAs are meant to **add depth** to alchemical systems, not flatten them.
- Their role is to **create build variety**, give players meaningful choices, and encourage the discovery of synergies.
- They should feel **rewarding**, but also **situational**, **interactive**, and **sometimes risky**.

---
##  Terminology & Categorization

To ensure clarity, each MTA includes standardized terminology:

- **Application Type:** Defines what the MTA can be attached to or used with (e.g., Brewing Station, Storage Unit, Container, Bottling, Freeform).
- **Install Method:** Indicates whether the MTA must be installed, functions passively, is activated via ritual, or has other setup requirements.
- **Compatibility Tier(s):** Specifies which Tier(s) of a system the MTA is compatible with. You cannot install a Tier 6-only MTA into a Tier 2 station unless stated otherwise.

These fields will appear on MTA entries and serve as both mechanical guidance and narrative flavor.

### • Themes & Interactions

Some MTAs carry **magical themes** or **planar alignments**—such as Infernal, Lunar, Fungal, Eldritch, Arcane, etc. These affinities may synergize with specific catalysts, potion properties, brewing environments, or ingredients. While not all MTAs will feature a theme, they add further flavor and depth to potioncrafting strategy.
