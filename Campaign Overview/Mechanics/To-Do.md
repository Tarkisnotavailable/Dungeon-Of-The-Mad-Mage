So let me write down what I want first.

- [ ] Remove the players being able to use pommel strike, it is not healthy for the game as they just hit the enemy and then hit them again with a pommel strike no matter their role and weapon.

- [ ] Make training an actual system. Skills/masteries will be added to the game (eg. greatsword mastery, dual handed mastery, magic mastery, dungeon exploration, scouting, trap disarment etc.) with ranks to follow: Initiate, Adept, Skilled, Expert, Master, Legend. Training these skills will require both training and experience. Characters will gain benefits from every level they achieve.

- [ ] Magic system needs work. I am okay with spells but aside from spells they cannot do anything. So as long as I allow, they will be permitted to do ritual spells and such.

- [ ] Properly manage stuff like Foraging, write down proper rules.

- [ ] Job opportunities. Allow them to take jobs in their downtimes.

- [ ] Better NPC interactions.

- [ ] Building Fame.

- [ ] Quest system. Will be introduced properly once I rework Undermountain and Yawning Portal.

- [ ] Equipment durability and maintenance. Equipments will get damaged in time and will require to be repaired, this cannot be done instantly and will require time. 

- [ ] Crafting. Proper crafting rules, yes they cannot craft but they can get people to craft for them.

- [ ] Traveling rules. It will be a more important part after Undermountain gets reworked.

- [ ] Offer random events for fun and plot points.

- [ ] Enchanted items. Compared to Magic Items they will be weak but they will still prove to be better than most normal weapons. Having basic passives and just straight stat boosts etc.

- [ ] Quests outside the town for occasional changes.

- [ ] Heat metal needs clarification.

- [ ] Flanking needs rebalancing.

- [ ] Sneak attack rebalancing.
