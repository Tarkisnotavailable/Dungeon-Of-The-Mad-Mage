## Sorrowborn of the Depths
The Sorrowborn of the Depths is a grotesque, elongated humanoid formed entirely of congealed grief, twisted sinew, and shadows that glisten like wet stone. Its limbs stretch unnaturally far, swaying as though underwater even when still. A crown of warped bone encircles its faceless head, and its torso bears the faint silhouettes of screaming faces—frozen in eternal anguish.

Born from the compounded misery of the tortured souls in the crypt, the Sorrowborn exists solely to echo their pain. Each time it falls, it splits, not into fresh bodies—but into mirrored fragments of suffering, clawing their way back to existence with less strength but more desperation. Its cries infect the mind, bypassing reason and memory to pierce the soul.

The creature is not tethered to life by flesh or spirit—but by unresolved torment. And until that torment is addressed, it will not stop.

### **Actions** (changes across phases)

_(Standard attacks, multiattacks, and abilities used in combat.)_

- **Multiattack** – **(Phase 1+)** 
    The Sorrowborn makes 2 attacks with **Distorted Limbs**. 
    If both attacks hit, the target must make a **DC 13 Wisdom save** or be frightened until the end of its next turn.
- **Ghost Scream** – **(Phase 3+)**
	As a bonus action, the Sorrowborn lets out a wail only the cursed can hear.  
	Choose one creature who has failed a **Wisdom** save during combat:
	They take **1d8** psychic damage and are **silenced** until the end of their next turn. (No verbal spells.)
- **Soul Shards** – **(Phase 4+)**
	Once per turn when taking damage, the Sorrowborn launches a fragment of its body.  
	A random creature within 20 ft. must make a **DC 13 Dexterity** save or take 1d8 necrotic damage and lose reaction until the end of its next turn.
- **Echoed Steps** – 
	The Sorrowborn can move through allies or copies without provoking opportunity attacks and can occupy their space momentarily (eerie visuals as if phasing through itself).
---
### **Legendary Actions / Reactions**
_(If a boss-level NPC, list any reactions or legendary actions.)_

- **Shriek of the Condemned (Recharge 5–6)** – **(Phases 1–4)**
	Each creature within 60 ft. must succeed a **DC 14 Wisdom** save or be stunned until the end of their next turn.
    **Phase 5:** This effect becomes a passive aura. Any creature that starts its turn within 10 ft. of any copy must succeed a **DC 14 Wisdom** save or be **deafened** for 1 minute and **frightened** until the end of its next turn. *(Repeatable save each turn.)*
- **Abyssal Cleave** – **(Phases 3-5)**
	(Uses when 20+ damage is taken. Uses instantly no matter whose turn it is.)
	Crowned lashes back at its enemies and attacks with its colossal cleaver in a 30ft cone. All creatures in the area must make a **DC 16 Dexterity save**, taking 3d8 slashing damage on a failed safe, or half as much on a success.
-  **Legend of Pain (Passive)** –
	While within 20 ft. of any copy of the **Crowned**, all creatures have disadvantage on death saving throws and **Wisdom (Insight)** checks.
