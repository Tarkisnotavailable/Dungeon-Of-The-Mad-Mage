#### Personality:
_A few key traits. Are they stoic, reckless, calculating, motherly, cryptic, etc.?_

- Calm:
    There is fury behind his gaze — a quiet, controlled burn that never spills into his actions. His composure is unshakable, his movements precise. Emotion sharpens him, never sways him. He does not waste words, nor motion.
- Discipline:
    Deeply disciplined and serious. He holds discipline above all else but isn't blind to the importance of rest and joy—he believes fun is earned, after one’s duties are fulfilled.
- Leadership:
	A natural leader. He knows how to stir the hearts of his allies and understands each of his subordinates intimately. This insight allows him to guide them with unmatched efficiency and care.

#### Appearance:
_Hair, height, body language, armor/clothing style, notable features._

Short, neatly trimmed silver hair.
A face marked with a few scars and sharp features that complement his stern expression.
A battle-hardened body that puts even seasoned warriors in their prime to shame.
Even in a casual stride, his footwork betrays the precision of a master — any swordsman, even a novice, would see it.
His form bears no flaw; a perfect guard maintained not just in battle, but at all times — a testament to his unyielding discipline.

---
#### Voice / Mannerisms:
_How they speak and behave. (e.g., slow and deliberate, fast-talking, sarcastic, speaks in metaphors.)_

Though his expression may show the flicker of fury, his actions remain precise, deliberate — untouched by the chaos within.
His presence commands without shouting; calm, yet heavy, like a blade drawn but not yet swung.
In battle, his words are few, but each one lands with the weight of steel.
He knows each of his subordinates not just by name, but by heart — their strengths, their flaws, their fears.
A true commander, not through grand speeches or theatrics, but by leading from the front, with unwavering purpose.
To follow him is not to chase glory — it is to move with certainty, as if the path ahead had already been cleared.
Those who follow him do not do so merely because he is their superior, but because they genuinely believe in their hearts that they want to follow him.

#### Background:
Former comrade of [[Durnan]], defensive fighter that was known as The Wall of Undermountain thanks to his place in the party as an exceptionally capable defender. It is said that the party is still alive thanks to him and Maya. Him and Grandola was always in each others throats because of their conflicted personalities and fought to death numerable times, Ban was the middle man between them and the only reason they haven't killed each other. After the party disbanded and everyone went their own ways he joined the Waterdeep's military and got assigned to a division. He gained the trust of his other knights and soon enough he got his own division consisted of the people he trusted. Him, 11 knights and an officer made up the Ragudo Division.

After getting trapped in the Battle Without Dawn crypt he tried to defy the fate that was brought upon his men and people, but he couldn't no matter how much he tried. He lost most of his sense of self and is currently waiting in his floor listening his men fighting a battle fated to lose over and over again.
