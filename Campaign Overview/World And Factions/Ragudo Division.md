Their achievements increased rapidly and they were known as the strongest knight division in no time. But nothing lasts forever. Officer Kim was contacted by an unknown informant and traded information with them. That information was nothing good but still needed confirmation, it didn't take them long to understand that this was the undeniable truth. Waterdeep was already in the grasps of a dangerous cult. First only Kim and Ragudo knew about this but they had to tell the others about this. He called them and told them that the ones that has a family was dismissed, but they refused and forced him to tell them everything. They met in an inconspicuous place and held a meeting, while they were telling so they were ambushed. Of course as the Ragudo Division at full strength nobody could defeat them, in the end they won but now they knew that the other party also knew about them. To not put their families in danger they tried to bait out the ones behind this and force them into a fight. They left leaving behind obvious traces and went to an uninhabited space to face them. The decisive battle had begun and waves of enemies came one after another. While the seemingly endless battle was going on, they understood they were facing something way more dangerous than they anticipated.
