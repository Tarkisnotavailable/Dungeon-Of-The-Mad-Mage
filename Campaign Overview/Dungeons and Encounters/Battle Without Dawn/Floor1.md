#### **Floor 1: The Prison of Eternal Suffering**

A torture chamber for anyone connected to the Knight Order or possessing knowledge of the cult's secret. The prisoners were tortured and transformed into undead, cursed to suffer eternally while remaining conscious. Their suffering is overseen by living armors—former death-row criminals—who act as wardens.

The Head Warden was once an officer sentenced to execution for leaking sensitive information but was instead turned into a Helmed Horror. He now researches necromancy in his office.

There are hints of the cults true objective scattered around the floor. The Abyssal Runes in the branding chamber. The Abyssal Runes engraved into the skeleton in Warden's Office. The secret alien Lake of the Abyss in the storage room. The creature born from the prisoners negative emotions at the last room.
