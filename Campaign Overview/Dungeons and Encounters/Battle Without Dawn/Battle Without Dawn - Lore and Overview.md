(**Rewrite this completely.**)

*A place of torture for the [[Ragudo Division]]. After discovering the cooperation between an evil cult and the Lords of Waterdeep, they attempted to reveal the truth but were caught and sent here to suffer.* 

This crypt consists of three floors.
- Floor 1: Where the people that cult wants gone gets tortured endlessly. Ragudo cannot access this floor.

- Floor 2: Ragudo Division repeats the same cycle. Fight an unbeatable battle, lose, repeat. Captain Ragudo tried to break this cycle but couldn't no matter how much he tried.

- Floor 3: Where Ragudo witnesses his division fight an endless battle and the people he swore to protect getting tortured without an end. Yet he remains unbroken waiting for the trigger to end this fate of his.

Party found a map that leads to the entrance of this crypt. It is located in City Of The Dead
