#### **Floor 2: Battle Without Dawn**

As you descend the ladder sounds of weapons clashing and incomprehensible shouting fills the halls. Once you descent completely a battlefield comes into view. 11 knights fighting for their lives, but their enemies aren't there. A knight's empty armor falls down followed by its comrades. Every single one of them falls down after getting "killed" by a force invisible to the eye. Then one by one they get back up and start fighting again, as if none of that happened. You do not even enter their vision, they are too busy fighting for their lives.

A place of torture for the 11 knights of the Ragudo Division. A battlefield with non-ending battle. A battle without dawn.

This floor consists of a big room that knights fight in and another hidden room where the Officer Roy of Ragudo Division awaits their salvation.
